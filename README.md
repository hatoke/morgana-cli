I make a cli for my requirement on development. Morgana doesn't have enough command yet. I will new command if i need. I guess, I will improve this cli at day by day.

## Example Commands

##### Version And Help

```
morgana-cli -v
morgana-cli help
```

##### Generate .gitginore file

```
morgana-cli init gitignore
```

### Roadmap

- [x] a working cli command
- [ ] convert typescript
- [ ] write test
- [ ] rollup vue plugin boilerplate generate
- [ ] express and fastify boilerplate generate
